<p>‚ÄúName Driven Development‚Äù, this is a ghost topic you can‚Äôt find on wiki. I just use it to remind me how much importance a good name can give. Maybe it‚Äôs just another bad nameüòÇ.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, why naming matters a lot is that it‚Äôs so closely related to refactoring. Here are some basic ideas I conclude</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good name reveals intention, shows legibility, and keeps clarity.</li>
  <li>Keep refactoring, until the name reveals the intention in an easy way.</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt bother about naming too much when developing. Let the test and implementation help reveal it‚Äôs purpose. Then make a good name.</li>
</ul>

<p>To tackle this non-existing topic, I‚Äôve googled around, reading and thinking. Here are some notes I made (to be updated).</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Missing</li>
  <li>Nonsense</li>
  <li>Honest</li>
  <li>Honest and Complete</li>
  <li>Does the Right Thing</li>
  <li>Intent</li>
  <li>Domain Abstraction</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why">Why</h3>

<p>The answer to that question lies at the heart of understanding, preventing, and paying off technical debt.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Indebted code is any code that is hard to scan.</li>
  <li>Technical debt is anything that increases the difficulty of reading code.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Shouldn‚Äôt the definition of technical debt be something about the cost and risk of changing code?</em></p>

<p>It turns out that the largest single thing developers <strong>spend time doing is reading code</strong>. More than design, more than writing code, more than scanning, even more than meetings (well, probably).</p>

<p><strong>Bugs come from incomplete understanding</strong>. Incomplete understanding arises when the system is harder to understand than we can store in our heads at once.</p>

<p>So if our definition of technical debt is code that is difficult, expensive, or risky to change, then the root cause of that is code that is hard to scan. And how do we make code easy to scan? Use good names to encapsulate details.</p>

<h3 id="how">How</h3>

<p>If we want to make code more scannable, we need to increase the percentage of relevant information that it screams at you. Which also means hiding the irrelevant information.</p>

<p>The process of reducing debt is simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Look at something.</li>
  <li>Have an insight.</li>
  <li>Write it down.
    <ul>
      <li>Ccomment. But <strong>comments</strong> aren‚Äôt actually part of the code. They duplicate the code, which causes all the usual duplication problems.</li>
      <li>If your insight is structural then it belongs in a <strong>name</strong>. If it is a runtime insight then use an <strong>assertion</strong>.</li>
      <li>Assertions need to be easy to find. So don‚Äôt litter them around your core code. Express your insight as an example and write it down in a test. And name the test about the insight (not about what code it happens to execute).</li>
      <li>So, insights belong in names.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Check it in.
    <ul>
      <li>Express your intent by naming your commit using a message.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The insight loop is all there is</p>

<ul>
  <li>Refactoring legacy code is running this loop and writing stuff down in names.</li>
  <li>Understanding legacy code is running this loop and writing stuff down as examples in tests.</li>
  <li>TDD is running this loop three times:
    <ul>
      <li>First a loop where we look at the customer interview and we write it down as one example in a test.</li>
      <li>Second a loop where we look at the test and we write it down in names in the code.</li>
      <li>Third a loop of refactoring the (new) legacy code.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Design is a loop where the place you look is ‚Äúhow hard was it to write this test‚Äù and you write down insights by changing names (usually fixing the Does the Right Thing step).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>

<p>Each transition is about refactoring.</p>

<p>For naming, there are six techniques that were proven to work for me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>spend a lot of time on inventing names</li>
  <li>use code reviews</li>
  <li>don‚Äôt hesitate to rename</li>
  <li>spend a lot of time on inventing names</li>

</blockquote>

<p>Don‚Äôt make objects that end with ‚Äòer‚Äô.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Managers - Every time I see one of these, I cringe. People will usually tell me what it does, long before they can tell me what it is. Is it a registry? Fine call it a registry. Is it a history or a log? Call it that. Is it a factory? Call it that.</li>
  <li>Controllers - Only good controller object I‚Äôve made in the last 20 years was an interface to a BallastVoltageController that represented a real world object. The fact that every single MVC implementation in the world has had a different role for Controller ought to tell us something about how well that idea fit.</li>
  <li>Organizer (and many like them) - Focus is on what it does. This is a great example of how easy it is to turn many of these ‚Äòers‚Äô into nouns. Call it an Organization. Now we‚Äôre focusing on what it is.</li>
  <li>Analyzer/Renderer/etc - Definitely examples of ‚Äúworker‚Äù objects. What if they had been Analysis/Rendering/etc.</li>
  <li>Builder/Loader/Reader/Writer/etc - Remove the focus from the objects being manipulated, and tend assume to much responsibility themselves.</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>

<p>From a distance, everything is object oriented, extra-cool, modern-flexible-etc, but as you get closer, you realize it‚Äôs just a thin veneer over procedural thinking (and don‚Äôt even get me started about being ‚Äúmodern‚Äù).</p>

<p>Fake OO names and harmful conventions</p>

<ul>
  <li>the -er suffix</li>
  <li>the -able suffix</li>
  <li>the -Object suffix</li>
  <li>the I- prefix</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Manager, Helper, Handler‚Ä¶</strong></p>

<p>Good ol‚Äô Peter Coad used to say: Challenge any class name that ends in ‚Äú-er‚Äù (e.g. Manager or Controller). If it has no parts, change the name of the class to what each object is managing. If it has parts, put as much work in the parts that the parts know enough to do themselves (that was the ‚Äú<strong>er-er Principle</strong>‚Äù).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Manager. When you need a Manager, it‚Äôs often a sign that the Managed are just plain old data structures, and that the Manager is the smart procedure doing the real work.</li>
  <li>Handler, again, is an obvious resurrection of procedural thinking. What is an handler if not a damn procedure?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Something-able</strong></p>

<p>It‚Äôs like calling a nail ‚ÄúHammerable‚Äù, because you known, that‚Äôs what you do with a nail, you hammer it. It encourages procedural thinking, and leads to ineffective abstractions.</p>

<p><strong>Something-Object</strong></p>

<p>When you don‚Äôt know how to name something, pick some dominant trait and add Object to the end. Again, the problem is that the ‚Äúdominant trait‚Äù is moving us away from the concept of an object. Object is dropped in just to avoid more careful thinking about the underlying concept.</p>

<p><strong>ISomething</strong></p>

<p>The problem is that it‚Äôs too easy to fall into the trap, and just take a concrete class name, put an I in front of it, and lo and behold!, you got an interface name. Sort of calling a concept IDollar instead of Currency.</p>

<p>Eg.</p>

<ul>
  <li>IList to RandomAccessContainer</li>
  <li>IEnumerable to Sequence.
    <ul>
      <li>A List is an IEnumerable (what??)</li>
      <li>A List is a Sequence (well, all right!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <p>Taking advice from writers, funny quotes, like Stephen King on refactoring, Hemingway on modelling with personas, .etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember: ‚Äúrename‚Äù is the simplest but most effective refactoring. Use it.</p>

<p><strong>Gater domain-specific vocabulary</strong>. Scan the domain model entities Wikipedia pages for names of related concepts. Read novels set in your customer‚Äôs domain to learn their jargon. Find out what they really mean.</p>

<p>Comments: the basics</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don‚Äôt say what the code does (because the code already says that)</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt explain awkward logic (improve the code to make it clear)</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt add too many comments (it‚Äôs messy and they‚Äôll get out of date)</li>
  <li>Explain why the code exists
    <ul>
      <li>When should I use this code?</li>
      <li>When shouldn‚Äôt I use it?</li>
      <li>What are the alternatives to this code?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>How to write good comments</p>

<ul>
  <li>Try to write good code first</li>
  <li>Try to write a one-sentence comment</li>
  <li>Refactor the code until the comment is easy to write</li>
  <li>Now write a good comment</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt forget the rules of good writing. (eg. remove unnecessary comments)</li>
</ul>
